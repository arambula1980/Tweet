Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Stock Prediction
Final Project EECS 486

Description of Project (abridged):
We want to collect tweets for a company (given a stock ticker) and perform a sentiment analysis on the tweets to see if one should buy the stock.
 
We do this by first finding the company's information, such as company name and other trademarked names, using the Yahoo Finance API. From there, we collect tweets using the Twitter Search API. We then tokenize the text and score each tweet based on sentiment. The scores are normalized by length of the tweet and weighed by the number of followers the tweet's author has. Once the scores are compiled, they are divided by the largest score and averaged.

The sentiment and emoji dictionaries were compiled from two different sources. The emoji dictionary was obtained from the University of Maribor's research and turned into a csv file. The sentiment library was collected from SentiWordNet. These dictionaries contain a positivity and negativity score for each token. We use these scores when obtaining the sentiment value of a tweet.

File Manifest:
app2.py

Datasets:
Collection of tweets from 4/3/17 to 4/10/17 for Ford, GM, Toyota, Tesla, and Volkswagen
